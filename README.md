Gamified social network for Webflow professionals


**Webflow Kingdom** is a gamified social network and marketplace for Webflow professionals. Unlike Upwork/Fiverr, it connects **pre-vetted teams** of complementary skills (designers + devs + AI marketers) for high-value retainer projects ($5k-50k/mo). Simplifies the entire value chain through gamification, Web3 verification, Solana payments, community team-building**, algorithmic cohesion analysis, and team trading.

## About the Project

**The Problem**: **70% of Webflow projects overrun budgets and 40% miss deadlines** [Webflow University][Agency Reports] due to communication gaps between siloed roles. Clients expect "one person does everything" but complex retainers need **4+ specialized roles** (front-facing account manager, designers, dev link, growth engineer). Solo freelancers burn out on retainers; agencies struggle with scope creep, revision loops, talent retention, and trust erosion. Kingdom delivers **pre-assembled, cohesive teams** with clear roles that solve these systematically.

**Webflow Kingdom Solution**: 
- **Pre-grouped + community-built teams** based on complementary skills
- **Gamified progression**: Teams level up through verified deliverables **+ cohesion exercises**
- **Algorithmic cohesion**: Private feedback → chemistry scores → team optimization
- **Team trading market**: Swap teammates based on cohesion data
- **Web3 trust**: Blockchain-verified reviews + deliverable proofs
- **Simplified everything**: Project management, Solana payments, AI matching, **team bonding**
- **Hybrid networking**: Online exercises + in-person meetups
